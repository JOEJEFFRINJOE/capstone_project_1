The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project aims to empower users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. 
By leveraging SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit, the project develops a user-friendly application enabling users to fetch, store, and query YouTube channel and video data efficiently.


TOOLS AND LIBRARIES UTILIZED:

STREAMLIT: The Streamlit library is employed to craft an intuitive user interface, facilitating user interaction for data retrieval and analysis tasks within the program.

PYTHON: Renowned for its simplicity and versatility, Python serves as the primary programming language for the entire project. 
It handles various aspects such as data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualization.

GOOGLE API CLIENT: The googleapiclient library in Python streamlines communication with diverse Google APIs. 
In this context, it connects with YouTube's Data API v3, enabling crucial data retrieval tasks including channel details, video specifics, and comments. 
This integration simplifies developers' access to YouTube's extensive data resources via code.

MONGODB: Leveraging a scale-out architecture, MongoDB has emerged as a favored choice among developers for crafting scalable applications with evolving data structures. 
As a document-oriented database, MongoDB accommodates both structured and unstructured data effortlessly, utilizing a JSON-like format for document storage.

POSTGRESQL: Known for its robustness and comprehensive features, PostgreSQL stands as an open-source, advanced database management system. 
It offers reliability and scalability, providing support for diverse data types and advanced SQL functionalities, thereby serving as a robust platform for storing and managing structured data.

YOUTUBE DATA SCRAPING AND ITS ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE: Engaging in YouTube content scraping necessitates a conscientious and ethical approach. 
This involves adhering strictly to YouTube's terms and conditions, securing appropriate authorization, and complying with data protection regulations. 
Responsible data handling practices, including safeguarding privacy and confidentiality and preventing misuse or misrepresentation, are paramount. 
Additionally, considerations must be made for the potential impact on the platform and its community, striving for a fair and sustainable scraping process. 
Adherence to these ethical guidelines ensures integrity while deriving valuable insights from YouTube data.
